2. The player is dealt two cards each with six symbols.
3. There will only be one matching symbol between the two cards.
4. The player has to identify the matching symbol, and click on that symbol in the row of symbols at the bottom of their screen.
5. If the guess is correct, a new pair of cards is dealt, starting a new round. If the guess is incorrect, the user can guess again until they get it right.
